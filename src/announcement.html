<h1 id="nano-adblocker-for-firefox-is-no-longer-maintained-">Nano Adblocker For Firefox Is No Longer Maintained!</h1>
<p>As of upstream <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/issues/362">sell the project to unknown developers</a>, I refuse to maintain the project for stranger(s) that never show up to introduce themselves to their users.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Unlike upstream, Nano Adblocker on this port is still under my control and not related to upstream&#39;s new developer(s)!</strong></p>
<p>For more details or questions, visit <a href="https://github.com/LiCybora/NanoDefenderFirefox/issues/187">my issue ticket</a>. If you can&#39;t read English, use a translator or raise your problem on <a href="https://github.com/LiCybora/NanoDefenderFirefox/issues/187">this issue ticket</a> such that other volunteer can help.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-">What Should I Do?!</h2>
<ol>
<li>Backup settings: In Nano Adblocker, Go to <code>Dashboard</code> &gt; <code>Settings</code> &gt; <code>Backup to files</code>. (Optional )</li>
<li>Backup Filter Lists: Take a screenshot of your Filter List such that you can recover later. (Optional)</li>
<li>Read through this article. You may also use an online version <a href="https://raw.githack.com/LiCybora/NanoCore2/master/src/announcement.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Disable/Remove Nano Adblocker: In Firefox, Go to <code>Add-ons</code> and Disable Nano Adblocker. You may also remove it later if you sure everything are backup and reversible.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="but-i-need-an-ad-blocker-">But I Need An Ad-blocker!</h2>
<p>Try <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a> where Nano Adblocker forked from. Their interfaces are similar and quite easy to familiar with. You may restore most settings from Nano to uBlock Origin by:</p>
<ol>
<li>In uBlock Origin, Go to <code>Dashboard</code> &gt; <code>Settings</code></li>
<li>Click <code>Restore from file...</code> and choose the file you backup from previous section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since uBlock Origin and Nano Adblocker do not share exactly same built-in filter list. In case restore cannot fully recover all filter list, you may manually add back according to the screenshot you take from previous section.</p>
<p>Of course, you are free to choose any ad-blocker you want! Above is just my personal recommendation.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-really-want-to-use-nano-adblocker-">What If I Really Want to Use Nano Adblocker?</h2>
<p>No problem, you can still use it. Filter list can still be updated and you can use it as usual. </p>
<p>But it is not recommended because you won&#39;t receive update anymore. No fix will be released when you experience issue(s). In future, you may not be able to use filter rule that is written in new syntax which is released after the retirement.</p>
<h2 id="timeline-for-retirement">Timeline for Retirement</h2>
<p>v1.0.0.154 will be the final version of Nano Adblocker. Extension will be unlisted from AMO one week after released, no more new installation form AMO. You may still install from <a href="https://github.com/LiCybora/NanoCoreFirefox">my repository</a> after that if you really want Nano Adblocker back.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended to install alternative instead of continue using Nano Adblocker, however.</p>

<p>Thanks for all volunteer that contribute to this project. Also thanks for users reporting issue to benefit other users as well. Thanks for all users choose Nano Adblocker as their content-blocker.
Hope everyone can still enjoy clean web site in future.</p>
