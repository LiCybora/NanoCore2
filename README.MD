1. Install latest version of Git and Node.js.
1. In an appropriate directory, run:
   1. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/LiCybora/NanoCore2.git`
   1. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters.git`

   1. Run `node ./term` to open Nano Core 2 Terminal.

Note: The private repository `Prototype` is required for publishing.

## Development

You should not modify the upstream repository, instead, use Nano Core 2
Terminal to create and manage development environment.

```
init	 Initialize source development environment
reset    Nuke development environment and create a fresh one without any
         patches applied
sync     Resynchronize all existing patches, in order
cont     Clear uncommitted changes and continue to resynchronize patches
         starting from the last one that failed (or from the beginning if
         nothing failed)
mark     Create a patch based on the difference between tip of resynchronize
         patches and current code in development environment

make     Build extension from development environment
pack     Build, test, then package the extension
publish  Build, test, package, then publish the extension
         Optionally pass browser name to make/pack/publish for only one browser
clean    Remove all build files

lmake    Build English locale file from locale definition
lsync    Synchronize (non-English) locale files with the latest build of the
         Crowdin project
         This will not rebuild the Crowdin project even if there are changes

config   Print active configuration data
reload   Reload configuration data
exit     Exit the terminal
```

### Creating a New Patch

1. Run `mark`
1. Copy generated patch file to an appropriate directory
1. Give the new patch a good name
1. Add it to the README file
1. Add it to the configuration file
1. Run `reload` in the Terminal

### Renaming a Patch

1. Give the patch a new name
1. Update the README file
1. Update the configuration file
1. Run `reload` in the Terminal

### Removing a Patch

1. Delete the patch file
1. Update the README file
1. Update the configuration file
1. Run `reload` in the Terminal

## Version Update Checklist

1. Pull filters updates
1. If needed, pull upstream updates then update about string and commit pin
1. If needed, pull upstream updates to build scripts
1. If needed, pull upstream updates to `assets.json` and `manifest.json`
1. If needed, pull upstream updates to `1p-filters.js` and `asset-viewer.js`
1. If needed, build and pull locale updates
1. Bump version number
1. Perform [sanity tests](notes/sanity_tests.md)
1. Add tags to repositories, and upload packages
1. Upload packages to extension stores

## Version Update Watchlist

These are the potential problems to look out for:

1. Development build detection logic
1. Font Awesome related CSS
1. Image resources
1. `/assets` directory structure
1. `scriptlets.js` format
1. Redirect declaration maps format in `redirect-engine.js`
1. Existance of `messaging` variable in `popup.js`
1. Local IP related regular expressions in `storage.js` (may need to update
   minimization scripts)
1. CNAME uncloaking (may need to adjust default advanced settings)

## Subresource Integrity Incidence Response Protocol

When there is a severe issue with the content of a subresource, an intervention
can be easily placed with the help of
[UltimateMirror](https://github.com/NanoMeow/UltimateMirror) and
[MirrorEngine](https://github.com/NanoMeow/MirrorEngine):

1. Lock the subresource in UltimateMirror
1. Remove problematic content from UltimateMirror, if needed
1. Update `assets.json` so the sanitized subresource will be loaded from
   UltimateMirror

Later, the intervention can be lifted as follows:

1. Update `assets.json` as appropriate, the subresource should no longer be
   loaded from UltimateMirror
1. Wait a bit for cache to expire (takes about 10 minutes), then restart
   MirrorEngine
1. Unlock the subresource in UltimateMirror

## Tips

To update a patch, simply paste further changes to the bottom of that patch and
`sync` them in.

To fix conflict, either edit the broken patch file manually or disable it
along with patches after it then recreate the changes.
